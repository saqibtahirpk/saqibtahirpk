I am a Product Consultant, Writer, and Podcaster.
My professional background is rooted in working closely with tech startups and software businesses.
I help founders and owners deliver products and projects, big and small, across a wide variety of categories.

See, at the heart of it – I love solving problems for people using tech.
It doesn’t get simpler than that.
I am known for consistent experimentation, ruthless prioritization, and relentless execution.

If I have an idea, it better have a .com at the end of it within the month.

There is a thing about ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’
Every next generation has advantages that the previous didn’t.
And I hope I can offer you some advantages along the way.

I’ve been working in the trenches of product delivery for over a decade.
Having closely worked with aspects of strategy, planning, execution, launch, and growth of both products and businesses.

With a decade of delivering successfully along with hands-on experience of 10,000+ hours in IT, Software Development, and SaaS -
I help great People build greater Products
